This is the Historical Data associated with Chapter 5 of my thesis, used for creating the geopolitical risk index based on
the sentiment analysis of the collected tweets. This data has been anonymized. As the data was quite large, I only uploaded
three portions of data. However, if you want to full unanonymized data, please reach out to me at jb370@st-andrews.ac.uk or 
burnsjack45@gmail.com so we can discuss any plans with the University of St Andrews, School of Computer Science Ethics 
Review Board as required.
