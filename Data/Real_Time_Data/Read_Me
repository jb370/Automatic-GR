Daily Outputs Description:
I have included a few days worth of examples of the daily outputs of the real-time 
analysis data, included in the file are the count and sentiment for each topic, 
and the changes for the count and sentiment, the count of languages for each file,
the topic modeling charts for each language, the Country counts folder which contains
the count of each mentioned in each tweet file, and two other files for Export topic 
and finance - topic which were experiments I investigated but did not dive into 
deeply. The Maps folder has examples of the NER maps, but not related to the files data.
