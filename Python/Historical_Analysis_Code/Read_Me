These are the historical analysis program files:

1. Historical Tweets Analysis Functionalized (sentiment analysis)
2. Historical Topic Modelling

This two program files are roughly the same as the Function_Filter_Test2 program and the DyAdF program, for 1 and 2, respectively.
The difference is that since for the historical data is only one time period, the program only needs to be run once for the sentiment
analysis. For Topic Modelling, the program is instead analyses the historical data week by week so the topics over time are day by day 
instead of hour by hour in the DyAdF program.
