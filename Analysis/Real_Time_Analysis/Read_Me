Real Time Analysis Files:

These zip files contain the analyses I ran on the real time data.

Analysis.zip: These are the various correlation analysis I ran on the data everyday during the real time collection period,
comparing the various geopolitical risk indicies based of the sentiment analysis of the tweets and the data of the 
various financial assets and market prices.

Granger_Tests.zip: Similiar to Analysis.zip, these were the Granger Causality tests I ran for the real time data to see 
if the indicies contained any predictive information about the financial assets. 

Topic Modelling.zip: This is the analysis I ran for the topic modeling results, comparing them to the Google Trends data
for the same topics at the hourly, daily, and weekly level.
